# Coding exercise - Application Report Trend

## Specifications

The task is to read a JSON file containing applications with their timestamps and omni-channels (sales, website, or qr). Provide a method that returns the average number (rounded up) of applications by hour (0 to 23) of the day across the total number of days available. The method also accepts a channel parameter (`all`, `sales`, `website`, and `qr`) to filter the results based on which channel the application came from. An `all` value returns all the applications regardless of channel.

A skeleton code (Ruby) and test (RSpec) has been provided to get you started. Write the necessary code to achieve the requirements and write tests for your solution.

## Data

A JSON data has been provided to get you started: `applications.json`. The fields are:

1. `id`: The ID of the application in UUID format.
2. `timestamp`: The time the application has been created which will be the basis of the report. This is in NZST timezone (+12).
3. `channel`: The omni-channel where the application came from. Valid values are `sales`, `website`, and `qr`.

The JSON file contains three days worth of data which will determine how you calculate for the average. The solution should not be restricted to three days as the data source can be dynamic, it should be able to adapt if there are more days added.

## Suggestions

- Make it simple and straightforward.
- Assume that the format of the JSON file provided is always correct. Do not think of the edge cases.
- Use of code linter is recommended. We will be looking at how you write and structure the solution.
- Remove unnecessary code or debuggers before submitting.

## Deliverable

- Provide the public git repository URL (e.g. GitHub), or a zip archive.
- The RSpec examples should be able to cover different scenarios, e.g. filters
- Update this README file containing the following:
  - Instructions how to run the specs
  - A technical overview of the implementation:
    - Summary or justification of the approach
    - Technical debts and/or areas to improve further if any

## Running the spec

Run `bundle exec rspec` to run the test

## Explanation

`ApplicationReport` class parses the JSON data into a collection of `OpenStruct` objects and calculate the average hourly trend based on the provided channel filter. The implementation uses a functional approach of breaking the main `retrieve_trend` method into smaller, focused methods that return a new data.

## Areas to Improve Upon

1. The current implementation don't have a lot of error handling since we assumed the JSON file is always correct.
2. Performance might consume significant memory if the JSON file is large. We might need to stream it or maybe read from a database.
3. I did not consider any timezone handling for this one since I need more information on what are the requirements or cases.
